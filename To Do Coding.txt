expose isDead in EnemyState as IObservable <- this way you can subscribe to the projectile controller prematurely


Enemies name , Should I number them? Should the Spawner give them a number/name, or should the ObjectPooler name them ?And what happens


Add tower config on projectileView in ObjectPooler <- could we pass Script config as a general parameter on the SpawnObject function?

Improve: 

=> _enemyView._spriteRenderer.DOFade(0,2f).OnComplete( () => EndEnemy());

=> fix this on ProjectileController: _enemy = _towerParent.GetComponent<TowerView>()._towerController.getTarget();
It goes against depency injection 
Options --> 
- Should we get the gameobject returned when we call the ObjectPooler, so that the Tower can pass the enemy to the controller? 
- Or should we overload the SpawnObject function so that the Tower can pass the enemy the to the controller?
- Could we add a callback function to SpawnObject?





Put spawn rate variable onto EnemyConfig scriptable object script.... √

fire rate should be fire interval √

tower config √
projectile duration to hit enemy √
fire rate √

! Tower shoots to enemy spawner when enemy killed (fix this) √
