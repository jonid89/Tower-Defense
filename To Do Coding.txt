! Tower shoots to enemy spawner when enemy killed (fix this) 

Enemies name 


Add tower config on projectileView in ObjectPooler <- could we pass Script config as a general parameter on the SpawnObject function?


Put spawn rate variable onto EnemyConfig scriptable object script.... √

fire rate should be fire interval √

tower config √
projectile duration to hit enemy √
fire rate √
