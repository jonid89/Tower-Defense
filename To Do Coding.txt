Put spawn rate variable onto EnemyConfig scriptable object script.... √

fire rate should be fire interval √

tower config √
projectile duration to hit enemy √
fire rate √

! Tower shoots to enemy spawner when enemy killed (fix this) √


5 enemies con Spawner config but only 3 appear, and -2 life

Enemies name 


Add tower config on projectileView in ObjectPooler <- could we pass Script config as a general parameter on the SpawnObject function?





fix this on ProjectileController: _enemy = _towerParent.GetComponent<TowerView>()._towerController.getTarget();
It goes against depency injection
