expose isDead in EnemyState as IObservable <- this way you can subscribe to the projectile controller prematurely



5 enemies con Spawner config but only 3 appear, and -2 life

Enemies name 


Add tower config on projectileView in ObjectPooler <- could we pass Script config as a general parameter on the SpawnObject function?

Improve: 

=> _enemyView._spriteRenderer.DOFade(0,2f).OnComplete( () => EndEnemy());

=> fix this on ProjectileController: _enemy = _towerParent.GetComponent<TowerView>()._towerController.getTarget();
It goes against depency injection





Put spawn rate variable onto EnemyConfig scriptable object script.... √

fire rate should be fire interval √

tower config √
projectile duration to hit enemy √
fire rate √

! Tower shoots to enemy spawner when enemy killed (fix this) √
